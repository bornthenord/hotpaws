# Keyborg
![Remap Mac Keys, Boost Productivity!](https://github.com/bornthenord/keyborg/blob/main/logo.png)


# What is?
The next time I moved my hand to the arrow keys on my keyboard to find another file, I realized that this couldn't go on. 

# How use
Capslock - enable/disable

## Configuration

The configuration consists of mapping rules ([key source]:[keys targets]:[modifier keys]) and comments (#)\
[key source] - the key to be redefined\
[keys targets] - keys (separated by commas) to which we assign\
[modifier keys] - modifier keys (separated by commas) to be pressed, not required


## Example

\# like vim navigation\
h:left\
k:up\
j:down\
l:right\
\# next tab\
s:left:option,command
